# Easy-Input-CSharp
A program for more "efficient" input in C#. <i>(This is absolutely redundant I just did something for fun)</i>
<br>
<br>
While I was experimenting in the language, I found that the input system was pretty inefficient (no offense ðŸ˜…) compared to Java's Scanner class <i>(because to be honest I have no clue about any language other than Java)</i>. So for my first program in C# - I present - an easy input system!
<br>
<br>
<b>An Overview of the Files:</b>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>ControlledInput.cs</b> - This class is similar to the 'Scanner' class in Java. It allows more control over the data types that a user is allowed to input in.</li>
  <li><b>EasyInput.cs</b> - This class contains the InputLine() method, which is similar to the 'input()' method in Python. It allows you to both print a line, as well as take input from the next line, all-in-one.</li>
  <li><b>Example.cs</b> - This is a test class, just used for testing the two input systems.</li>
